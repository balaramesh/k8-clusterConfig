Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run (as a regular user):

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join --token cee087.b75544122f97eae6 192.168.0.18:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:4b3348ad92d77145d155d171f232bcef7dbfca7cfa3c2bf5ff58fad31e65a6c8

Warning: kubectl apply should be used on resource created by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply
